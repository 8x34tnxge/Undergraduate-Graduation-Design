  abstract = {In recent years, considerable attention has been given to research on various aspects of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) applications. UAVs are currently used for various military and civilian missions in the air, sea, space, and on the ground. In two recent papers, Shima (2007) and Kim (2007) considered closely similar m-UAV problems. In Shima (2007), the problem is considered with each target being served by only one UAV to minimize the total travel distance across all UAVs (called load balancing), however, in Kim (2007), the problem is considered with maximum number of targets that each UAV can serve with the objective of minimizing load balancing. Kim presented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of the load balancing problem both for when the UAVs return to their original depot and when they do not. Shima presented a combinatorial optimization formulation of their model with a branch-and-bound solution procedure. The MILP formulation of the load balancing problem is also adaptable to Shima 's problem. However, there are major inefficiencies with the MILP formulation presented in Kim 's model. In fact, The MILP formulations presented in Kim are highly complicated with huge number of variables and constraints making them impractical for applications. The purpose of the present note is to provide explicit MILP formulations that dramatically reduce the number of variables and the number of constraints for variety of UAV tour assignment problems including the two models mentioned above and via simulation we show significance of these new formulations.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of risk in the environment and presents a new stochastic formulation of the UAV task assignment problem. This formulation explicitly accounts for the interaction between the UAVs /sub i/splaying cooperation between the vehicles rather than just coordination. As defined in the paper, cooperation entails coordinated task assignment with the additional knowledge of the future implications of a UAV's actions on improving the expected performance of the other UAVs. The key point is that the actions of each UAV can reduce the risk in the environment for all other UAVs; and the new formulation takes advantage of this fact to generate cooperative assignments that achieve better performance. This change in the formulation is accomplished by coupling the failure probabilities for each UAV to the selected missions for all other UAVs. This results in coordinated plans that optimally exploit the coupling effects of cooperation to improve the survival probabilities and expected performance. This allocation is shown to recover real-world air operations planning strategies that provide significant improvements over approaches that do not correctly account for UAV attrition. The problem is formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem, which is shown to be more computationally tractable than previous MILP solution approaches. Two DP approximation methods (the one-step and two-step look-ahead) are also developed for larger problems. Simulation results show that the one-step look-ahead can generate cooperative solutions very quickly, but the performance degrades considerably. The two-step look-ahead policy generates plans that are very close to (and in many cases, identical to) the optimal solution and the computation time is still significantly lower than the exact DP approach.},

The algorithm generates a stealthy path through a set of enemy radar sites of known location, and provides an intuitive way to trade-off stealth versus path length. In the first step, a suboptimal rough-cut path is generated through the radar sites by constructing and searching a graph based on Voronoi polygons. In the second step, a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations are simulated, using the graph solution as an initial condition. The ODEs describe the dynamics of a set of virtual masses located in a virtual force field. The virtual forces push the masses away from the radar and toward one another. The ODEs are simulated to find a locally, exponentially stable equilibrium solution, which is interpreted as the optimal path. A simulation is provided to illustrate the idea.},

The UAV flies between a given pair of initial and final locations, during which it needs to accomplish certain computation tasks by offloading them to some selected GBSs along its trajectory for parallel execution. Under this setup, we aim to minimize the UAV's mission completion time by optimizing its trajectory jointly with the computation offloading scheduling, subject to the maximum speed constraint of the UAV, and the computation capacity constraints at GBSs. The joint UAV trajectory and computation offloading optimization problem is, however, non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed design significantly reduces the UAV's mission completion time, as compared to benchmark schemes.},

  abstract = {Multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently recognized as one of the top emerging technologies to be utilized in various smart city domains such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They represent an innovative mean to complement existing technologies to surveil transportation network, control traffic, and monitor incidents. The UAVs usually operate for time-limited missions due to their limited battery capacity. Hence, they need to frequently return to their docking stations to recharge their batteries, which handicaps their mission coverage and performance. When designing a UAV-based ITS infrastructure, it is crucial to leverage the UAV fleet effectively. In this paper, a generic management framework of UAVs for ITS applications is developed. The problem of docking/charging station placement is first investigated to find optimized locations for a given number of stations to be installed by the ITS operator. To this end, two fundamental criteria are taken into account: i) the flying time required by the UAV to reach the mission/incident location and ii) the risk of battery failure during the UAV operation. The two algorithms, namely a penalized weighted k-means algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, are designed for this purpose. Once the docking stations are placed, a UAV scheduling program is formulated to optimally cover the pre-known missions while minimizing the total energy consumption of the fleet and respecting a coverage efficiency targeted by the ITS operator. The proposed proactive scheduling approach employs multiple UAVs in sequential and parallel ways to cover spatially and temporally distributed events in the geographical area of interest over a long period.},

The generated trajectory named as γ-trajectory, transits between two consecutive waypoint segments in a “smooth” manner. For this trajectory the shortest distance from the waypoint can also be set to a desired value based on the limited capacity of the sensor mounted on the MAV. Subsequently, a loop-trajectory is generated, which is important if the vehicle is required to track the entire waypoint segments as well as the waypoints. Since the trajectory is composed of circles of minimum turn radius and straight lines, this is computationally fast and real-time implementable. Finally, the implementation of generated trajectory is illustrated in an environment cluttered with obstacles and several aspects of the generated trajectory are compared with those of the trajectories obtained using techniques available in the literature.},

This paper investigates the cellular-connected UAV mobile edge computing systems where the UAV is served by terrestrial base station (TBS) for computation offloading. For tackling the large number of bits of UAV, we propose a resource partitioning strategy where one portion of tasks is migrated to TBS for computing and the other portion of tasks is locally computed at UAV. Our goal is to minimize the UAV energy consumption by jointly optimizing resource partitioning, UAV trajectory and bit allocation under the constraints of UAV mobility and TBS energy budget. The formulated problem is shown to be a non-convex optimization problem, which is hard to tackle. To this end, we derive a sub-optimal solution by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. The numerical results show that there exists a tradeoff between propulsion energy consumption of UAV and computation energy consumption of UAV. In addition, it also shows that our proposed scheme saves a large amount of energy compared with the benchmark scheme.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobile edge computing system is studied where several UAVs are associated to a terrestrial base station (TBS) for computation offloading. To compute the large amount of data bits, a part of computation task is migrated to TBS and the other part is locally handled at UAVs. Our goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of all UAVs by jointly adjusting the bit allocation, power allocation, resource partitioning as well as UAV trajectory under TBS's energy budget. For deeply comprehending the impact of multi-UAV access strategy on the system performance, four access schemes in the uplink transmission is considered, i.e., time division multiple access, orthogonal frequency division multiple access, one-by-one access and non-orthogonal multiple access. The involved problems under different access schemes are all formulated in non-convex forms, which are difficult to be tackled optimally. To solve this class of problem, the successive convex approximation technique is employed to obtain the suboptimal solutions. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme save significant energy consumption compared with the benchmark schemes.},

To create a more realistic mission scenario, we involve several types of constraints in this problem, such as kinematic constraints, resource constraints (both boarded weapons and fuels), and time constraints (both task sequences and time windows). Due to the prohibitive computational complexity of the problem, a novel meta-heuristic based on a modified genetic algorithm is proposed to improve the solution of this stochastic task assignment problem.

In the simulation part, the effect of the proposed algorithm, both on searching capability and convergence speed, is demonstrated by comparison with the random search algorithm. Moreover, the stochastic nature of this problem caused by the stochastic flight velocities is also illustrated by comparison with a deterministic model.

In this paper, we propose a new class of problems that generalizes the standard Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) by addressing complex tasks and constraints on the mission, called the ‘mission specifications’, expressed in a high-level specification language. In the generalized problem setup, these mission specifications are naturally specified using the Linear Temporal Logic language LTL−X. Using a novel systematic procedure, the LTL−X specification is converted to a set of constraints suitable to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation, which in turn can be incorporated into two widely-used MILP formulations of the standard VRP. Solving the resulting MILP provides an optimal plan that satisfies the given mission specification. The paper also presents two mission planning applications.

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm using a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Using visual sensing, real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed.},

By combining the advantage of communication technology and UAV, rapid response can be made at disaster area and used as a mobile base station in place where traffic demand is high, such as concert venue and sports stadium. In addition, by using data that have been collected by mounted sensors and cameras, the UAV can provide data-based application. However, these services usually use big data processing and machine learning techniques which require high computing power and the UAV is not sufficiently capable of process those applications due to lack of computing resources and battery limitation. To overcome this problem, the UAV can offload task to near Mobile Edge Server that can provide computing resources. Mobile Edge Server can be cellular base station, Wi-Fi access point and so on. When tasks occur in a specific area, one or more UAV need to move the location to acquire data and process. If data processing is too heavy to process at local, the UAV can cooperate mobile edge server. In this situation, we can find out two problems. (i)When the tasks occur, which UAV can process occurred task (ii) When UAV is assigned a task, then a mobile edge server can cooperate with UAV.

  abstract = {Recently, Combining communication technology with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been regarding as one of the promising techniques in the future network. Various services can be served through UAV, such as information collection in disaster area or traffic monitoring in smart city. However, on-board computation resource and the battery lifetime of UAV are limited. For that reason, there is a limit to perform analysis, such as, machine learning using collected data. In this situation, UAV can get help from an adjacent Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server that has computing resources. However, the closest MEC server does not always guarantee optimal computing performance and communication efficiency. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the overall system of machine learning based UAV to MEC computation offloading for data analyzing. First, we define the problems into two. Firstly, we define two problems 1) matching UAV and task cluster in consideration of energy efficiency. 2) Finding optimal MEC server to offload the task to minimize the total processing time and energy consumption. Then, we apply a machine-learning algorithm to solve the two problems. In the simulation section, we analyze the proposed method and greedy method in terms of total energy consumption and total processing time. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is efficient in total energy consumption of UAV and total processing time of tasks.},

The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an ini ial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.},

  abstract = {Due to the limitations of mobile devices in terms of processing power and battery lifetime, cloud based solutions offer an attractive approach to answer these shortcomings. Since offloading intensive computation tasks to an edge/cloud server would achieve impressive performances, computation offloading paradigm has attracted the focus of many research groups in the last few years. This paper considers the problem of computation offloading while achieving a tradeoff between execution time and energy consumption. The proposed solution is intended for a fleet of small drones that are required to achieve highly intensive computation tasks. Drones need to detect, identify and classify objects or situations. Thus, they are brought to deal with intensive tasks such as pattern recognition and video preprocessing. The latter implement very complex calculations and typically require dedicated and powerful processors, which would definitely accentuate the dilemma between energy and delay. We adopted a game theory model where the players are all the drones in the network with three possible strategies. We defined the cost function to be minimized as a combination of energy overhead and delay. The simulation results are very promising and the achieved performances outperformed their counterparts in terms of average system wide cost and scalability.},

Then, a dynamic planning algorithm is designed which uses task subcontracting and dynamic re-decomposition to coordinate conflicts.

The use of UAVs to provide commercial courier has become an emerging industry, remarkably shifting the energy use of the freight sector. However, due to limited battery capacities, the flight duration of civilian rotorcraft UAVs is still short, hindering them from performing remote jobs. In this case, people customarily utilize ground vehicles to carry and assist UAVs in various applications, including cargo delivery. Most previous studies on vehicle-drone cooperative parcel delivery considered only one UAV, thereby suffering from low efficiency when serving a large number of customers. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm, which supports the cooperation of a ground vehicle and multiple UAVs for efficient parcel delivery. Our routing and scheduling algorithm allows multiple UAVs carried by the vehicle to simultaneously deliver multiple parcels to customers residing in different locations. The proposed algorithm consists of a pipeline of several modules: population management, heuristic population initialization, and population education. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm has significant efficiency over existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a tree search algorithm for assigning cooperating homogeneous uninhabited aerial vehicles to multiple tasks. The combinatorial optimization problem is posed in the form of a decision tree, the structure of which enforces the required group coordination and precedence for cooperatively performing the multiple tasks. For path planning, a Dubin's car model is used so that the vehicles' constraint, of minimum turning radius, is taken into account. Due to the prohibitive computational complexity of the problem, exhaustive enumeration of all the assignments encoded in the tree is not feasible. The proposed optimization algorithm is initialized by a best-first search and candidate optimal solutions serve as a monotonically decreasing upper bound for the assignment cost. Euclidean distances are used for estimating the path length encoded in branches of the tree that have not yet been evaluated by the computationally intensive Dubin's optimization subroutine. This provides a lower bound for the cost of unevaluated assignments. We apply these upper and lower bounding procedures iteratively on active subsets within the feasible set, enabling efficient pruning of the solution tree. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the performance of the search algorithm is analyzed for two different cost functions and different limits on the vehicles' minimum turn radius. It is shown that the selection of the cost function and the limit have a considerable effect on the level of cooperation between the vehicles. The proposed deterministic search method can be applied on line to different sized problems. For small-sized problems, it provides the optimal solution. For large-sized problems, it provides an immediate feasible solution that improves over the algorithm's run time. When the proposed method is applied off line, it can be used to obtain the optimal solution, which can be used to evaluate the performance of other sub-optimal search methods.

Given a fleet of trucks, where each truck carries a given number of drones, the objective consists in designing feasible routes and drone operations such that all customers are served and minimal makespan is achieved. We formulate the VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), which can be solved by any standard MILP solver. Moreover, with the aim of improving the performance of solvers, we introduce several sets of valid inequalities (VIEQ). Due to limited performance of the solvers in addressing large instances, we propose a matheuristic approach that effectively exploits the problem structure of the VRPD. Integral to this approach, we propose the Drone Assignment and Scheduling Problem (DASP) that, given an existing routing of trucks, looks for an optimal assignment and schedule of drones such that the makespan is minimized. In this context, we propose two MILP formulations for the DASP. In order to evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art solver in tackling the MILP formulation of the VRPD, the benefit of the proposed VIEQs, and the performance of the matheuristic, we carried out extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, the use of drones can significantly reduce the makespan and the proposed VIEQ as well as the matheuristic approach have a significant contribution in solving the VRPD effectively.},

Achieving their fast travel and low motion energy without inter-UAV collision under wind perturbation is a daunting control task, which incurs huge communication energy for exchanging UAV states in real time. We tackle this problem by exploiting a mean-field game (MFG) theoretic control method that requires the UAV state exchanges only once at the initial source. Afterwards, each UAV can control its acceleration by locally solving two partial differential equations (PDEs), known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. This approach, however, brings about huge computation energy for solving the PDEs, particularly under multi-dimensional UAV states. We address this issue by utilizing a machine learning (ML) method where two separate ML models approximate the solutions of the HJB and FPK equations. These ML models are trained and exploited using an online gradient descent method with low computational complexity. Numerical evaluations validate that the proposed ML aided MFG theoretic algorithm, referred to as MFG learning control, is effective in collision avoidance with low communication energy and acceptable computation energy.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), one of the most popular and effective unmanned systems, is gradually becoming the vital element of aviation because of its high success rate in both military and civilian missions. Basic problem of UAV is finding the best path in tough environment. Coverage zones of radars and complex environment are the main obstacles in this problem. A UAV intends to travel all control points in an optimal way to be more productive while avoiding radars. In this paper, we used Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is Evolutionary algorithm, to find the optimal flyable path for the UAVs in a 3D environment. Each generation is anticipated to be better than its previous generation in GA. For the purpose of reaching an optimal path, solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the major phases in the proposed method. In order to show the visual of solution in better quality, we preferred MATLAB as the implementation environment. Additionally, there is a shared library and mathematical calculations are easier in MATLAB. The complexity of our problem can be increased by adding extra constraints caused by the dynamic environment as the future works.

Under such community-aware scenarios, we prove that it remains NP-hard to maximize system overall profit. To solve this problem effectively, we present a heuristic algorithm that is composed of three phases: 1) task selection: select the desirable task to be allocated preferentially; 2) allocation to community: allocate the selected task to communities based on a significant task-first heuristics; and 3) allocation to agent: negotiate resources for the selected task based on a nonoverlap agent-first and breadth-first resource negotiation mechanism. Through the theoretical analyses and experiments, the advantages of our presented heuristic algorithm and community-aware task allocation model are validated. 1) Our presented heuristic algorithm performs very closely to the benchmark exponential brute-force optimal algorithm and the network flow-based greedy algorithm in terms of system overall profit in small-scale applications. Moreover, in the large-scale applications, the presented heuristic algorithm achieves approximately the same overall system profit, but significantly reduces the computational load compared with the greedy algorithm. 2) Our presented community-aware task allocation model reduces the system communication cost compared with the previous global-aware task allocation model and improves the system overall profit greatly compared with the previous local neighbor-aware task allocation model.},

  abstract = {Different Earth observation resources (EORs) [e.g., satellites, airships, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)] are usually managed by different organization sub-planners, which lack interactions and cooperation among one another. Such independent resource operations are no longer efficient to meet diverse and vast observation requests, especially in emergency situations, such as earthquakes, flooding, and forest fire disasters. This paper addresses the issue of coordinated planning of heterogeneous EORs, including satellites, airships, and UAVs. A hierarchical coordinated planning architecture is proposed to integrate heterogeneous EORs for the construction of a distributed and loosely coupled Earth observation system. The architecture comprises four component categories, namely, observation resource, sub-planner, coordination, and information management. Moreover, we propose two task assignment algorithms to coordinate and allocate observation tasks to sub-planners. The first algorithm is a highest-weight-first-allocated algorithm, and the second is a tabu-list-based simulated annealing (SA-TL) algorithm. Experiments and comparative studies demonstrate the efficiency of the coordinated planning architecture and SA-TL algorithm. We also show that the system responds dynamically to unexpected situations through effective disturbance-handling mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Efficient scheduling is significant for the effective use of scarce satellite resources. Task clustering has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of satellite scheduling. However, current task clustering strategies are static, i.e., they are integrated into the scheduling in a two-phase manner rather than in a dynamic fashion, without expressing their full potential in improving the satellite scheduling performance. In this study, we present an adaptive simulated annealing–based scheduling algorithm integrated with a dynamic task clustering strategy (ASA-DTC) for satellite observation scheduling problems (SOSPs). Firstly, we develop a formal model for the scheduling of Earth observing satellites. Secondly, we analyse the related constraints involved in the observation task clustering process. Thirdly, we detail an implementation of the dynamic task clustering strategy and the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm. The adaptive simulated annealing algorithm is efficient and contains sophisticated mechanisms, i.e., adaptive temperature control, tabu-list-based short-term revisiting avoidance mechanism and intelligent combination of neighbourhood structures. Finally, we report on experimental simulation studies to demonstrate the competitive performance of ASA-DTC. We show that ASA-DTC is particularly effective when SOSPs contain a large number of targets or when these targets are densely distributed in a certain area.},

Search and rescue path planning is carried out through the strategy iteration of Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, distributed RL is used to recognize the channel state and perform mobile computing, so as to optimize the data throughput in the communication group.

Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is conceived for the task scheduling in a certain UAV, which improves the efficiency of the task execution in each UAV.

However, the utmost challenge is how to transfer the important and urgent information to the control center as quick as possible in face of communication and computation constraints. As one of the promising technologies, mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can be deployed on UAVs to support computation-intensive and latency-critical applications. Therefore, a joint communication and computation optimization model is established for a MEC enabled UAV network, which includes a centralized MEC enabled top-UAV and a swarm of distributed bottom-UAVs. Using stochastic geometry, the successful transmission probability results for a single link and a group of links are derived based on the three-dimensional distribution of UAV swarm. Moreover, the optimal response delay is theoretically achieved with the closed-form solutions by using stochastic geometry and queueing theory. In contrast to the conventional UAVs without MEC capabilities, the optimal response delay is achieved by using our proposed joint communication and computation optimization algorithm in the MEC enabled UAV swarm scenario. The performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated based on the results from the simulation system and the hardware testbed.},

This algorithm adopts the distributed control architecture which divides the global optimization problem into several local optimization problems. Each UAV is able to solve its own local optimization problem, and then make the optimal decision for the multi-UAV system through the information exchange among UAVs. The search-attack mission planning process is divided into two phases, the one is waypoints generation under constraints of UAV's maneuverability, collision avoidance and maximum range, the other is path generation which takes account of the threat avoidance. In the first phase, an improved distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is presented to carry out the mission planning and generate waypoints. Considering the range constraint of UAV, a new state transition rule is designed to guide UAV back to its initial point within the maximum flight range. In the second phase, Dubins curve is employed to smoothly connect the waypoints generated by the ACO. As for the unexpected threats during the flight, an online threat avoidance method is proposed to replan the paths. Finally, simulations are carried out to analyze the convergence performance, external responsiveness and internal scalability of the proposed ISOA for the multi-UAV search-attack mission planning problem.},

Since unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can quickly reach the affected areas and obtain images, they are widely used in the post-earthquake rapid assessment. However, sensor noise and other unavoidable errors can affect the quality of images acquired by sensors attached to the UAVs, which can, in turn, reduce the quality of the assessment. We defined a new problem in the application of multiple UAVs in the rapid assessment of earthquake-stricken regions. The rapid-assessment task-assignment problem (RATAP) was used to construct the assignment plan for multiple UAVs in a rapid-assessment task while considering the weights of potential targets, the endurance of the UAVs, and the sensor errors. The RATAP was formulated as a variant of the team orienteering problem (TOP) called the revisit-allowed TOP with reward probability (RTOP-RP). We then developed an efficient hybrid particle swarm optimization with simulated annealing (HPSO-SA) algorithm, which produced a high-quality solution for the RATAP, and confirmed the effectiveness and rapidity of our algorithm through numerical experiments. Finally, we conducted a case study based on real-world data from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China to demonstrate our approach.},
